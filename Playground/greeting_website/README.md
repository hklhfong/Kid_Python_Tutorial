# Simple Greeting App

Welcome to the Simple Greeting App! This Flask-based web application provides a friendly interface where users can enter their name and receive a personalized greeting. It's a perfect example of how Flask can be utilized for basic web interactions and to demonstrate the use of forms and responses in a web application.

## Features

- **Personalized Greetings**: Users can input their name to receive a personalized message.
- **Flash Messages**: Utilizes Flask's flash message functionality to provide feedback based on user interaction.

## Installation

To run this application, you'll need Python and Flask installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-greeting-app.git
   cd simple-greeting-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Set the Secret Key**

   The application uses a secret key to maintain session data. You can set your secret key in the code, but for production environments, it is recommended to set it via an environment variable.

   ```python
   export SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"  # On Windows use `set SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"`
   ```
